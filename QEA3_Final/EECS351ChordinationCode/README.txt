README for Professor Diaz and Siddharth Venkatesan

To see our algorithm in action, run the MATLAB file ChordinationDemo.m,
which calls our Chordination Function with the audio file "HeyJudeVerse1.wav".
The function will play the audio and output the corresponding detected chords.
It will also output a plot showing the detected notes versus time.

NOTES: The Chordination algorithm requires that the MATLAB Communication Systems
Toolbox is installed on the user's computer. (This is for the function de2bi).
Also, it requires that chordMapFull.mat and 
chordMapSimple.mat are in the same folder as the function.

If you would like to try different audio files or different parameters with 
Chordination, we have also included a usage description at the beginning
of Chordination.m.
